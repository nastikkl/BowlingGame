The game consists of 10 frames. Each frame is composed of up to two rolls. 
The tenth frame is special and is composed of up to three rolls. If the first roll is a strike then the player will roll two more times. If the second roll is a strike or spare then the player will roll a third time. 
The final game score is a sum of all frame scores. 

A frame score is a sum of all the pins knocked down during the rolls with two exceptions. The 'spare' and the 'strike' are special scoring conditions. 
A spare is when the first roll knocks down less than ten pins and the second roll knocks down the remaining pins. A spare is calculated as 10 plus the number of pins knocked down on the next roll. 

For example: On frame 1 the player rolls a 9 and then a 1 which results in a spare. On frame 2 their first roll is a 5 which makes the score for frame 1 a 15 (10+5). 
A strike is when a roll knocks down all ten pins. The frame score is calculated as 10 plus the next two rolls. 

Example 1: On frame 1 the player rolls a 10 (strike). On frame 2 the player rolls an 8 and a 1. The score for frame 1 is 19 (10+8+1). 
Example 2: On frame 10 the player rolls a strike. Their next two rolls are also strikes. Score for the frame is 30 (10+10+10).
